as well as how to use the program.

Name: Syed Thahirr Shahid
This program allows the user/client to file their T4, RRSP, and T4A form 

How to use this program
=========================
Step 1: Fill out the T4 Form by choosing 1 in the main menu then 1 again in the tax form menu .
Step 2: Fill out all the information that the program asks for
Step 3: Fill out the RRSP Form by choosing 2 in the form selection menu
Step 4: Fill out the T4A form by choosing 3 in the form selection menu
Step 5: Go back to the main menu by typing back 
Step 6: Choose 3 to make a txt and a pdf file with the form that has been filled out 


Ability of the program: 

An extra that I added is the ability to get more information on the boxes that has to be filled. By Choosing 2 in the main menu then typing in the 
form name and box number ex.T414 which then will dynamically execute the getmoreinfo.py file passing the input through argv array, using the system function then the result will be printed
on the screen. I used Python Dictionary to store and retrieve the values.  

The program also has the ability to print to a txt file, then it use that txt file information to create a pdf file.
